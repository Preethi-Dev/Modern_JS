# Modern_JS
Learn modern JS from basic concepts 

    - this keyword

        => this keyword used to point context object (current object)

        => if we declare it outside object, value of 'this' keyword is windows object/global object

        => if we use 'this' keyword within arrow function, it doesn't change thier default window object to current object.

        => use normal function for 'this' keyword

    - Primitive and Reference Type

        => Primitive type 
        
            - variables (accessor of thier value) and thier values stored in stack, it's quick access and small space

            - Except object, all are primitive type

        => Reference Type 

            - variables and pointer for thier values(object type => array, object, date and so on) stored in stack

            - values(object type => array, object, date and so on) are stored in heap memory, it's bit slow and large memory space

    - Math Objects

        => Math.round() //method

        => Math.ceil()

        => Math.floor()

        => Math.trunc()

        => Math.random()

        => Math.PI //property

        => Math.E
