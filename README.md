Learn modern JS from basic concepts 

    - this keyword

        => this keyword used to point context object (current object)

        => if we declare it outside object, value of 'this' keyword is windows object/global object

        => if we use 'this' keyword within arrow function, it doesn't change thier default window object to current object.

        => use normal function for 'this' keyword
